# Etch-a-Sketch  
**Odin Project - JavaScript Challenge**  

This project is part of the **JavaScript Foundations** course from The Odin Project. It focuses on strengthening essential web development skills—**HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**—through the creation of an interactive Etch-a-Sketch app that runs directly in the browser.

## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a functional Etch-a-Sketch application where users can draw by hovering over a grid of squares, reset the board, and change the grid dimensions. The primary objective was to practice JavaScript fundamentals, especially event handling and DOM manipulation.

### Key Skills Practiced:
- **HTML & CSS**: Structuring and styling the app, ensuring it’s visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Managing event listeners, handling user input, manipulating the DOM, and using random number generation for color effects.

## Features
- **Drawing Functionality**: Users can draw on the grid by hovering over the squares, which change color dynamically.
- **Reset Button**: A reset button clears the board by resetting all squares to the original color.
- **Adjustable Grid Dimensions**: Users can change the grid’s dimensions (e.g., from 16x16 to 24x24) for a more customized drawing experience.

## How It Works
1. **Drawing**: When a user hovers over a square in the grid, the square’s background color changes to a random color.
2. **Resetting**: Clicking the "Reset" button resets the colors of all squares to the default (white).
3. **Changing Grid Size**: The "Change Dimensions" button prompts the user to input a new grid size (e.g., 16, 24, etc.), and the grid adjusts accordingly.

## Reflection
This project was a great exercise in combining problem-solving with practical coding skills. It helped solidify the understanding of JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and how to work with user input dynamically. I also learned the importance of breaking a larger task into manageable steps, ensuring smooth interaction between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
